# 🧠 Car Price Prediction Web App 🚗💸

This project is a **Machine Learning-powered web app** that predicts the **selling price of a used car** based on various input features like year, fuel type, kilometers driven, etc.  
It’s built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and a simple **HTML/CSS frontend**, with a trained regression model under the hood.
